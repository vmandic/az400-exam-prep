- "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." according to Donovan Brown.

- For this exam and this self-paced preparation I will cover and learn about:

1. How to plan for DevOps.
2. Use source control.
3. Scale Git for an enterprise.
4. Combine artifacts.
5. Design a dependency management strategy.
6. Manage secrets.
7. Implement continuous integration.
8. Implement a container-build strategy.
9. Design a release strategy.
10. Set up a release management workflow.
11. Implement a deployment pattern.
12. Optimize feedback mechanisms.

- DevOps professionals streamline delivery by optimizing practices, improving communications and collaboration, and creating automation. They design and implement application code and infrastructure strategies that allow continuous integration, testing, delivery, monitoring, and feedback.

- You must create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project for some exercises. How to: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops - I already have a few on dev.azure.com but I will use the one linked to my certification profile.

- basic assumption about software development: OODA; Observer, orient, decide and act.

- "Your cycle time determines how quickly you can gather feedback to determine what happens in the next loop."

- Learn to apply **validated learning.** - this is factual feedback on which you can take actions to improve in the next cycle. -> Always strive to OPTIMIZE this learning process.

- Applying DevOps principles helps in a multitude of ways:

1. faster release cycle with smaller release batches
2. use more automation
3. hardens release pipelines
4. improves telemetry of overall process
5. deploy and release more frequently

- apply Agile ideas like sprints to batch release work items and optimize its size

- define a "Definition of Done"

- embrace cloud and its IaaC principles - define infrastructure as code with automation to teardown and create environments

- develop a practice of appliying DevOps, improve your fitness, strive to achieve more and apply more of its principles every day to get better at it

- when starting to embrace DevOps in an existing company it is a good practice to form a new team that will start embracing its principles and then slowly outgrow to other parts of the company and its teams

#### DevOps should tackle shared goals like

- Reduce the time spent on fixing bugs by 60%.
- Reduce the time spent on unplanned work by 70%.
- Reduce the out-of-hours work required by staff to no more than 10% of total working time.
- Remove all direct patching of production systems
- Provide excellen customer value.

- "Measurable goals also need to have timelines." -> "It is essential to have an ongoing series of short-term goals."
