- Changing customer requirements pose a big challenge to the waterfall approach. Waterfall is rigid.

- "Customers often don't know what they want until they see it or can't explain what they need."

- A different approach is agile: Agile methodology constantly emphasizes adaptive planning and early delivery with continual improvement.

- Agile embraces change and small increments, it runs by releases that deploy one or more changes (sets). Agile is flexible.
